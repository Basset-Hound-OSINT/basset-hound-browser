the submit form for the flask app is supposed to open a new tab like how a normal browser does, not a new window in the electron app, here is the flask app and html for reference. then the electron app code for reference. please modify the electron app to handle the opening of a new tab from the flask app just as it does a user clicking the new tab button that already exists in the electron app. I don't want to edit the flask app at all, please provide the full updated code for the electron app components to compensate for the flask app
